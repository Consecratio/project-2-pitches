## Project 2 Goals

In your second project you will create a full stack Express and Postgres app which has:
- *At least x2 models, and utilize and build at least one relationship between the two models.*
- *Sequelize as an ORM to interact with and create your database.*
- *An Express server utilizing EJS/EJS layouts for UI design and styling.*
- *Interaction with and inclusion of at least one API.*

## Project 2 Pitch Guidelines

In designing and building your project, you will start by forking and cloneing this repository, and then editing this README to include the following information: 
1. Name of your app
    * Spellbook
2. Tech stack you plan to use
    * Postgresql
    * Express
    * Node.js
    * Boostrap
3. Simple wireframes
     * ![Wireframe](images/Wireframe.jpg)
5. API you plan to use
    * http://www.dnd5eapi.co/
6. Example of how to call/invoke your API, and a description of what data comes back.
    * https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/  -- Lists all Spells
    * https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/acid-arrow/ -- Lists details about the spell
7. MVP goals (x3-5)
    [] Make login page for users to have individual "spellbooks"
    [] Allow users to browse list of spells and add them to a "spellbook"
    [] Allow users to "homebrew" their own spells by being able to modify their saved spell's name/description/damage dice/material costs/etc.
8. Stretch goals (x2-5)
    [] Instead of a list of spells in the spellbooks, use Bootstrap to do flip card animations
    [] Use Bootstrap Modals to allow for "homebrewing" of spells
    [] Add list of classes who can use the spells
9. Any potential roadblocks?
    * Keeping a user "signed in" while they traverse each page.
